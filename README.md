# REST-API-with-Flask

This project is a simple User Management REST API built using Python and Flask. It demonstrates the core functionality of a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API that allows clients to manage user data via HTTP requests.

The API is designed for learning and demonstration purposes, using in-memory storage (Python dictionary) to store user records. It can be tested using Postman or cURL.
